To set up a CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins** that triggers on GitHub commits, builds your project, and deploys the new build
to an Apache server on Ubuntu, follow these key steps:

## 1. Jenkins Installation and Setup on Ubuntu

- Install Jenkins on your Ubuntu server and ensure it is running. Jenkins requires Java (e.g., OpenJDK 8) installed
  beforehand.
- Access Jenkins via its web UI to configure jobs and pipelines[1][4][8].

## 2. Configure GitHub Integration

- Create a Jenkins job (Freestyle or Pipeline) and configure **Source Code Management** to use your GitHub repository URL.
- Set up a webhook in your GitHub repo settings pointing to your Jenkins server to trigger builds on every push[2][4][8].

## 3. Create Jenkins Job / Pipeline for Build and Deploy

- **Freestyle Job Approach**:

  - In Jenkins, create a new Freestyle project.
  - Under “Build Triggers,” enable “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.”
  - Under “Build,” add shell commands or scripts to build your project (e.g., compile, test).
  - Add a post-build step to deploy the build artifacts to your Apache server.

- **Pipeline Script Approach**:
  - Use a Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline) in your repo to define stages:
    - Checkout code
    - Build (e.g., run build scripts)
    - Deploy (copy files to Apache server)

## 4. Deploying to Apache Server via SSH

- Generate an SSH key pair on the Jenkins server.
- Add the Jenkins public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of the Apache server user.
- Store the private key securely in Jenkins credentials.
- Use SSH or SCP commands in Jenkins build steps to copy the build artifacts to the Apache server’s document root (e.g.,
  `/var/www/html/`)[3][4][8].

Example shell deployment step:

```bash
scp -i /path/to/private_key -r ./build/* user@apache-server:/var/www/html/
```

Or use Jenkins plugins like **Publish Over SSH** for easier management.

## 5. Example Pipeline Script Snippet

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/your/repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh './build.sh' // or your build commands
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sshagent(['jenkins-ssh-key-id']) {
          sh 'scp -r build/* user@apache-server:/var/www/html/'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `sshagent` requires Jenkins SSH credentials configured with your private key[3][4][8].

## Summary

- Jenkins monitors your GitHub repo for changes via webhook.
- On commit, Jenkins pulls code, builds it, and deploys the output to the Apache server via SSH/SCP.
- This automates your CI/CD pipeline fully on Jenkins and Ubuntu[1][2][3][4][8].

This approach is widely used and can be extended with testing, notifications, and rollback mechanisms as needed.
