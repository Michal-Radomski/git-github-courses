## CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub to Apache Server on Ubuntu

To achieve a CI/CD pipeline where every commit pushed to your GitHub repository triggers a build and then uploads the new
build to an Apache server running on Ubuntu, you can use **GitHub Actions** for automation. Below is a practical step-by-step
guide.

---

**1. Prerequisites**

- GitHub repository with your project code
- Ubuntu server running Apache (with SSH access)
- SSH key pair for secure, passwordless authentication
- GitHub repository secrets configured for secure credentials

---

**2. Generate and Configure SSH Keys**

- On your local machine, generate an SSH key pair (if you don't already have one):

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

- Add the **public key** (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of your Ubuntu server user (e.g., `ubuntu` or
  `www-data`).

- Add the **private key** (`id_rsa`) as a secret in your GitHub repository (e.g., `SERVER_SSH_KEY`).

---

**3. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a workflow YAML file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Hereâ€™s a template you can adapt:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # (Optional) Add build/test steps here
      # - name: Build project
      #   run: ./build.sh

      - name: Deploy to Apache server
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SERVER_SSH_KEY }}
          source: "build/*"
          target: "/var/www/html/"
```

- `SERVER_HOST` and `SERVER_USER` should also be added as secrets in your GitHub repository.
- Adjust the `source` and `target` paths as needed for your project structure and Apache document root.

---

**4. What This Workflow Does**

- **On every push to the `main` branch**, the workflow:
  - Checks out the latest code
  - (Optionally) Builds/tests your project
  - Securely copies the build output to your Apache server using SSH and SCP[3][2]

---

**5. Security Best Practices**

- Never commit your private SSH key to the repository.
- Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive information.
- Limit the SSH key to only the necessary permissions on your server.

This setup gives you a lightweight, cost-effective CI/CD pipeline using only GitHub Actions and your Ubuntu server, with no
external dependencies or cloud platforms required[3].
