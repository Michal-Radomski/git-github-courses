The default method for merging commits in Git is the **recursive merge strategy**, which is used when branches have diverged
and require a new merge commit to combine their histories. Here's how it works:

### **How Recursive Merging Works**

1. **Common Base Commit**: Git identifies the common ancestor (base commit) of the two branches being merged.
2. **Three-Way Merge**: Git compares the changes in both branches relative to the common base commit. It combines these
   changes into a new "merge commit."
3. **Merge Commit**: The merge commit has two parent commits—one from each branch—preserving the histories of both branches.

This strategy ensures that all changes from both branches are integrated while maintaining the full history of development.
If conflicts occur (e.g., the same lines in a file are modified in both branches), Git pauses the merge and requires manual
resolution before proceeding[1][2][3].

### **Other Merge Strategies**

While recursive merging is the default, Git supports other strategies for specific scenarios:

1. **Fast-Forward Merge**: Used when no new commits exist on the target branch since branching occurred. Git simply moves the
   branch pointer forward, creating no additional merge commit.
2. **Squash Merge**: Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging, simplifying history.
3. **Octopus Merge**: Used for merging multiple branches simultaneously, typically in non-conflicting scenarios[3][4][5].

Recursive merging is ideal for preserving detailed history, especially in collaborative workflows where branches diverge
frequently.
