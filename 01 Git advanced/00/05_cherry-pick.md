Git **cherry-pick** is a command that allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another without merging the
entire branch. It is useful for situations where you need to incorporate particular changes without bringing in unrelated
modifications.

### **How Cherry-Pick Works**

1. Cherry-picking identifies a specific commit by its unique hash (SHA-1) and applies the changes from that commit to the
   current branch.
2. A new commit is created in the target branch with the same changes as the original commit but a different commit hash,
   preserving the integrity of both branches.

---

### **Syntax**

The basic syntax for cherry-picking is:

```bash
git cherry-pick
```

- ``: The SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to apply. You can find this using `git log`.

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Backporting Bug Fixes**: Apply a bug fix from a development branch to a stable or production branch.
2. **Applying Hotfixes**: Extract and apply critical fixes to production without merging unrelated changes.
3. **Correcting Misplaced Commits**: Move commits accidentally made in the wrong branch to the correct one.
4. **Reusing Changes Across Branches**: Apply specific updates across multiple branches without duplicating work.

### **Example**

#### Cherry-Picking a Single Commit:

1. Find the commit hash:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
2. Switch to the target branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout
   ```
3. Apply the commit:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick
   ```

#### Cherry-Picking Multiple Commits:

List multiple hashes and apply them sequentially:

```bash
git cherry-pick
```

### **Best Practices**

- **Conflict Resolution**: Cherry-picking can lead to conflicts if changes overlap between branches. Resolve conflicts
  manually before completing the operation.
- **Testing Changes**: Always test cherry-picked changes to ensure they integrate correctly into the target branch.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Cherry-picking can complicate history by creating duplicate commits, so use it sparingly and only when
  necessary.

Git cherry-pick is a powerful tool for precise integration of changes, but it requires careful handling to avoid conflicts
and maintain clean repository history[1][2][3][4].
