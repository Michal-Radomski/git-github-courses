The difference between `git commit -am` and `git commit -m` lies in how changes are staged and committed:

### **`git commit -m`**

- **Purpose**: Commits only the changes that have already been staged.
- **Usage**: Requires you to explicitly stage changes using `git add` before running the command.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git add
  git commit -m "Added new feature"
  ```
- **When to use**: Use this when you want precise control over which files are staged and committed.

### **`git commit -am`**

- **Purpose**: Stages and commits all modified _tracked_ files in one step. Tracked files are those already known to Git
  (i.e., previously committed).
- **Usage**: Combines the staging (`-a`) and message (`-m`) options into a single command.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git commit -am "Fixed bug in login functionality"
  ```
- **Limitations**: It does not stage new files; you still need to use `git add` for untracked files.
- **When to use**: Use this for quick commits when you've only modified existing tracked files.

### Key Differences

| Feature          | `git commit -m`                      | `git commit -am`                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Staging Changes  | Requires manual staging (`git add`). | Automatically stages modified tracked files.        |
| New Files        | Requires `git add`.                  | Does not stage new files; requires `git add`.       |
| Workflow Control | Provides finer control over staging. | Faster for committing all changes to tracked files. |

Choose the appropriate option based on your workflow needs and whether you're working with new or existing files.
