To add build artifacts to a GitHub repository, you can use GitHub Actions to upload them as artifacts or include them in a
release. Here's how:

---

### **1. Upload Build Artifacts Using GitHub Actions**

You can save build results (e.g., static files or compiled binaries) as artifacts in your workflow. Use the
`actions/upload-artifact` action:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build project
    run: npm run build

  - name: Upload build artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: build-artifacts
      path: dist # Replace 'dist' with the folder containing your build output
```

- **`name`:** The name of the artifact.
- **`path`:** The directory or files to upload.

Artifacts are stored in the workflow run and can be downloaded later from the Actions page[4][5].

---

### **2. Publish Build Artifacts to GitHub Releases**

To make artifacts publicly available, you can upload them to a GitHub release using the `ncipollo/release-action`:

```yaml
release:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
  steps:
    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-artifacts
        path: dist

    - run: zip -r build.zip dist/

    - uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
      with:
        artifacts: "build.zip"
        tag_name: v1.0.0 # Specify the release tag
        release_name: "Release v1.0.0"
```

This approach creates a release and attaches the artifact (e.g., `build.zip`) as an asset[4].

---

### **3. Directly Commit Artifacts to Repository**

You can also commit and push artifacts directly to your repository:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build project
    run: npm run build

  - name: Commit and push artifacts
    run: |
      git config --global user.name "GitHub Actions"
      git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"
      git add dist/
      git commit -m "Add build artifacts"
      git push origin main
```

This is less common since repositories are typically used for source code rather than generated files.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use `upload-artifact` for temporary storage between jobs.
- Use releases for distributing public assets.
- Avoid committing large artifacts directly into the repository unless necessary.
