Git handles changes using a combination of snapshots and deltas to efficiently track modifications in your repository. Here's
an explanation of how Git manages changes and the concept of deltas:

### **How Git Handles Changes**

1. **Snapshots**:

   - Git primarily uses a snapshot-based model to record the state of files at a specific point in time.
   - When you commit changes, Git creates a snapshot of your repository by storing the contents of all tracked files.
   - If a file hasn't changed since the last commit, Git simply references the previous snapshot instead of duplicating the
     file.

2. **Staging Area**:

   - Before committing, changes are added to the _staging area_ using `git add`.
   - The staging area allows you to select specific changes for inclusion in the next commit.

3. **Commits**:
   - Each commit represents a snapshot of the repository at a particular moment.
   - Commits are identified by unique hashes (SHA-1).

### **What Are Deltas?**

- **Definition**: A delta is a representation of the difference between two versions of a file or repository state.
- **Usage in Git**:
  - While Git stores snapshots for commits, it internally uses deltas for efficient storage and transfer.
  - For example, when transferring data between repositories (e.g., during `git fetch` or `git pull`), Git sends only the
    deltas instead of full snapshots to minimize bandwidth usage.

### **Snapshot vs. Delta**

| Feature        | Snapshot                                | Delta                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Captures the entire state of files.     | Represents differences between states.                    |
| **Storage**    | Used for commits in local repositories. | Used internally for optimization (e.g., packing objects). |
| **Efficiency** | Simpler but larger storage requirement. | More compact and efficient for transfers.                 |

### **Advantages of Git's Approach**

1. **Efficiency**:
   - By combining snapshots and deltas, Git ensures fast operations and efficient storage.
2. **Flexibility**:
   - You can revert, cherry-pick, or rebase commits easily due to its snapshot-based structure.
3. **Integrity**:
   - Every commit is uniquely identified by its hash, ensuring data integrity.

### Example Workflow

1. Modify files in your working directory.
2. Stage changes with `git add`.
3. Commit changes with `git commit`, creating a new snapshot.
4. When transferring or packing objects, Git uses deltas to optimize resource usage.

By leveraging snapshots for local operations and deltas for efficient storage and transfer, Git provides a robust mechanism
for managing source code changes effectively.
